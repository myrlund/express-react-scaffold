A sweet JS stack
================

This is a scaffold for future apps to be built with Express and React, with a Gulp setup consisting of ES6 transforms, JSX transforms, SCSS compilation, image minification, â€“ everything linted and live-reloaded selectively on code changes.

Config is shared between server and Gulp in `config.js`.

TODO
----

Add simple Flux architecture with API helpers etc.
